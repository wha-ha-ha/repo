_Equivalent Exchange 2:_ A Mod in a Time Capsule
===============

This is a repo for a port of the brilliant and popular Minecraft mod Equivalent Exchange 2 by x3n0ph0b3. Rewritten from the ground up with as much historical accuracy as possible!

I won't be posting code here until I talk to x3n0ph0b3, but in the meantime we have a readme with a road map of what needs doing.

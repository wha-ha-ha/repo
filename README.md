_Equivalent Exchange 2:_ A mod in a time capsule
===============

This is a repo for a port of the brilliant and popular Minecraft mod Equivalent Exchange 2 by x3n0ph0b3. Rewritten from the ground up with as much historical accuracy as possible!

I won't be posting code here until I talk to x3n0ph0b3, but in the meantime we have a readme with a road map of what needs doing.

What Needs Doing
===============

###Misc

* Update to 1.7.10. (Currently version 1.6.4)

###Known Bugs To Be Fixed

* Gem of Eternal Density working improperly inside Alchemy Bags

* Visual slot sync issues with shift clicking in Transmutation Tablets

* Visual slot sync issues with shift clicking Klein Stars in Collectors and Relays

###Incomplete/Unimplemented Items

#####Incomplete Items

* Harvest Goddess Band needs left and right click functionality

* Void Ring needs in-chest/bag effect (will probably be trivial once density gem is fixed)

* DM/RM picks and Morning Star need proper harvest values for DM/RM Blocks

* Nova Catalyst and Cataclysm need to actually go boom (historical accuracy is difficult but key here)

#####Unimplemented Items

* Ring of Arcana

* Archangel's Smite

* Watch of Flowing Time

* Evertide/Volcanite Amulets

* Hyperkinetic and Catalytics Lenses

* Dark Matter Pedestal

* All Armors


##Contribution Guidelines For Possible Posterity?
===============
Maintaining as close to 100% faithfulness to the original EE2 as possible is the major overarching principal behind this project.

If you are making a PR containing a gameplay addition or change, make sure you have thoroughly tested for perfect-as-possible accuracy against the original mod in-game. The wiki above is not always correct. When something is found on the wiki but not in-game, the in-game evidence takes precedence over the wiki.

Stick to the original ID map of the mod. I don't care if you can fit two new items into the same block/item ID, the ID scheme of the original mod is to be used.

If you are planning to PR something that wasn't in the original EE2, __DON'T__. But feel free to write an addon! I love addons.

Feel free to squash any and all unintentional bugs in the code and optimize things, so long as this does not affect gameplay mechanics in any way.
